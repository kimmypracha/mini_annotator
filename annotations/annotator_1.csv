Design a database system using ER Diagram to support a ticketing platform that manages events, venues, users, ticket sales, and payments, ensuring efficient tracking and management of all related data.

### Scenario Description
The ticketing platform serves as a central hub for managing events across various venues. Users can browse upcoming events, purchase tickets, and make payments through the platform. Each event is associated with one or more venues, which has a defined capacity and location. Users can register on the platform to buy tickets, and they may also be attendees of the events. The system must handle multiple types of events, such as concerts, sports matches, and theater performances, each with unique attributes like start time, duration, and special requirements (e.g., age restrictions).

Tickets are sold for specific events and must be tracked from purchase to event attendance. The platform supports multiple payment methods, and each transaction must be securely recorded, including details such as payment amount, method, and timestamp. The system should also allow for dynamic pricing based on demand and event proximity. Additionally, the platform must provide a way to manage refunds and cancellations, adhering to specific business rules.

### Constraints
- Each event must be associated with one or more venues, and each venue can host multiple events, but not simultaneously.
- Users can purchase multiple tickets for different events, but each ticket must be uniquely associated with a single user and event.
- The system must track historical data for ticket sales and payments, including any refunds or cancellations.
- Venue capacity must be enforced, ensuring that ticket sales do not exceed the available seats.
- Payment transactions must be securely recorded, with support for various payment methods, and linked to the corresponding ticket sales.
- The system should allow for dynamic pricing adjustments based on predefined rules, such as time to event or ticket demand.
- Users may have roles that evolve over time, such as becoming VIP members, which may affect ticket pricing and availability.",

Draw an ER diagram for a healthcare system which is designed to manage and streamline the operations of a healthcare facility by efficiently organizing and tracking patient care, doctor interactions, appointments, treatments, and prescriptions.

### Scenario Description
In a healthcare facility, patients receive care from doctors through scheduled appointments. Each patient can have multiple appointments with one or more doctors, and each appointment is associated with specific treatments and, potentially, prescriptions. Treatments are tailored to the patient's medical needs and are administered during appointments. Prescriptions are issued by doctors and may be linked to specific treatments or given independently based on the patient's condition.

Doctors have unique specialties and can treat multiple patients, while patients may consult various doctors based on their health requirements. The system must track the history of appointments, treatments, and prescriptions for each patient to ensure continuity of care. Additionally, doctors need access to patient medical histories to make informed decisions about treatments and prescriptions.

### Constraints
- Each patient must have a unique identifier within the system to ensure accurate tracking of medical records.
- Doctors are categorized by specialty, which influences the types of treatments they can administer.
- Appointments must be scheduled with specific start and end times, and no two appointments for the same doctor can overlap.
- Treatments may require multiple sessions, which should be tracked individually yet linked to the original treatment plan.
- Prescriptions must include dosage instructions and a validity period, after which they cannot be refilled without a new consultation.
- The system should allow for the recording of appointment outcomes, including any changes in treatment plans or new prescriptions issued.
- Historical data for appointments, treatments, and prescriptions must be retained for at least five years to comply with regulatory requirements.",

Design an ER diagram for a learning management system which is designed to facilitate the management and delivery of educational content through an online platform, supporting users in roles such as students and instructors, and enabling the administration of courses, lessons, enrollments, and assessments.

### Scenario Description
In an educational institution, a Learning Management System (LMS) is implemented to support online learning. The system allows users to register and assume roles as students, instructors, or administrators. Instructors create courses, each consisting of multiple lessons. Students enroll in courses and complete lessons at their own pace. Assessments are integral to the learning process, allowing students to demonstrate their understanding of course material. These assessments can be associated with entire courses or specific lessons, depending on the instructional design.

The LMS must handle various workflows, such as course creation by instructors, student enrollment management, lesson delivery, and assessment grading. Users must be able to switch roles if they have the appropriate permissions, such as a student who becomes an instructor. The system should support tracking of student progress and provide feedback through assessment results.

### Constraints
- Users can have multiple roles, but each role has specific permissions and capabilities within the system.
- Courses are composed of lessons, and each lesson belongs to one and only one course.
- Students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have many students enrolled.
- Assessments can be linked to either courses or individual lessons, and a single assessment may apply to multiple lessons or courses.
- Enrollment periods are defined for each course, and students can only access course materials during this period.
