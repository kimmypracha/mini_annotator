Create a diagram that visually represents the parts of a cell, illustrating each organelle and its basic function. The purpose of this diagram is to provide a clear and educational overview of cell structure and the role of each component within the cell.

## Constraints
- Include common organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and cell membrane.
- Use distinct color coding to differentiate between types of organelles, ensuring that each organelle is easily identifiable.

## Supplementary Data
- **Nucleus**: Controls cell functions.
- **Mitochondria**: Generates energy for the cell.
- **Ribosomes**: Responsible for building proteins.
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum**: Transports materials within the cell.
- **Golgi Apparatus**: Packages and ships proteins.
- **Lysosomes**: Breaks down waste materials.
- **Cell Membrane**: Regulates the entry and exit of substances in and out of the cell.",
