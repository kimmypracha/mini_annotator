## Problem  

### Domain Context  
The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) encompasses a series of phases that guide the development and maintenance of software systems. It includes planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase has specific objectives and deliverables, but the SDLC does not cover detailed programming techniques or user interface design specifics. The intended audience includes individuals with a foundational understanding of software development processes, such as undergraduate students or entry-level professionals.  

### Guiding Questions  
- What are the main phases of the Software Development Lifecycle, and what is the primary focus of each phase?  
- How do the objectives of the planning phase differ from those of the design phase in the SDLC?  
- What are the key deliverables associated with the testing phase, and why are they critical to the SDLC?  
- In what ways does the maintenance phase ensure the longevity and effectiveness of a software system?
