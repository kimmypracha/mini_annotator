## Problem  

### Domain Context  
Computer Science at the undergraduate level encompasses several core areas, including Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Algorithms. These areas cover the organization and manipulation of data, the design and analysis of computational processes, and the management of computer resources. Topics outside this scope, such as advanced software development or network security, are not included unless they directly pertain to these core subjects.

### Guiding Questions  
- What are the fundamental components of Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Algorithms in Computer Science?  
- How do different data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, manage and organize data?  
- What are the primary functions and responsibilities of an operating system in managing hardware and software resources?  
- How are algorithms designed and analyzed for efficiency and correctness in solving computational problems?
