## Problem  

### Domain Context  
Sustainable architecture and green building design encompass the principles and practices aimed at minimizing the environmental impact of buildings. This field includes energy efficiency, the selection of sustainable materials, water management strategies, and considerations of the overall environmental impact of construction and operation. It is intended for undergraduate students or professionals in architecture or environmental science. Topics such as purely aesthetic design principles or traditional construction methods without environmental considerations fall outside this domain.  

### Guiding Questions  
- What are the main principles of sustainable architecture and green building design?  
- How is energy efficiency achieved in sustainable architecture?  
- What criteria are used in the selection of materials for green building design?  
- In what ways can water management be integrated into sustainable building practices?  
- How do environmental impact assessments influence architectural design decisions?
