## Problem  

### Domain Context  
Climate change impacts encompass the various ways in which changes in the Earth's climate affect natural systems, human societies, and economies. This field includes the study of environmental effects such as rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity. It also examines social and economic consequences, including effects on agriculture, health, and infrastructure. This domain does not cover mitigation strategies or policy responses to climate change.

### Guiding Questions  
- What are the main categories of impacts resulting from climate change on the environment and society?  
- How does climate change affect biodiversity and ecosystems?  
- In what ways does climate change influence human health and economic stability?  
- What are the mechanisms through which climate change leads to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters?
