### 1. Thoughts

This scenario requires a two-dimensional evaluation because the product launch campaign involves multiple tasks that need to be prioritized based on their impact and effort. The chosen dimensions lead to meaningful trade-offs between the resources required and the potential reach of each task. The reader must evaluate each task's demands on time, budget, and manpower, as well as their potential to generate buzz and drive engagement.

### 2. Comparative Scenario

#### Objective  
The marketing team is preparing for a product launch and must decide how to allocate resources across various promotional activities. Each task has different demands and potential benefits, requiring careful prioritization.

#### Dimensions of Comparison  
- One consideration involves the resources required for each task, such as time, budget, and manpower. Some tasks might demand significant upfront investment or coordination.  
- Another consideration is the potential reach of each task, which relates to how widely and effectively the task can engage the target audience and generate interest in the product.

#### Items for Evaluation  

> **Social Media Campaign**  
> Developing a series of posts and interactive content for platforms like Instagram and Twitter. This requires a creative team and regular updates but can reach a large audience quickly.

> **Press Release Distribution**  
> Crafting and sending out a press release to industry publications and news outlets. It requires coordination with PR professionals and can potentially reach a wide audience if picked up by major outlets.

> **Blog Content Creation**  
> Writing detailed articles and product reviews for the company blog. This involves content writers and editors, and while it may not reach as wide an audience immediately, it can improve SEO and provide long-term engagement.

> **Influencer Collaboration**  
> Partnering with influencers to showcase the product. This requires negotiation and possibly financial incentives but can quickly reach niche audiences through trusted voices.

> **Launch Event Planning**  
> Organizing a launch event, either virtual or in-person, to showcase the product. This involves significant logistical planning and budget but can create a memorable experience for attendees.

> **Email Marketing Campaign**  
> Designing and sending a series of emails to existing customers and leads. This requires a well-maintained mailing list and creative content but can directly reach a targeted audience.

> **Video Content Production**  
> Creating promotional videos for platforms like YouTube and TikTok. This involves a production team and equipment but can engage viewers through dynamic content.

> **Customer Testimonials and Case Studies**  
> Gathering and publishing testimonials from early users. This requires coordination with existing customers but can provide authentic endorsements that resonate with potential buyers.

This setup allows the team to assess each task's demands and potential benefits, facilitating strategic decision-making for the product launch campaign.
