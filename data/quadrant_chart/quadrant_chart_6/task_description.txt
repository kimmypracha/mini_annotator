### 1. Thoughts

For a competitive analysis of project management tools like Trello and Notion, it's crucial to use a two-dimensional evaluation that captures the unique needs of creative teams. The chosen dimensions should reflect the balance between flexibility in project structuring and ease of collaboration, as these are essential for creative workflows. This setup encourages evaluative judgment and strategic reflection on how each tool supports diverse project types and team interactions.

### 2. Comparative Scenario
