## Objective
Design a sequence diagram that illustrates the complete two-factor authentication process when a user logs into a secure system. The diagram should capture the interactions between the user, the authentication server, and any other relevant entities involved in the authentication flow.

## Expected Diagram Format
Sequence Diagram: A type of diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case, focusing on the order of messages exchanged between the objects.

## Constraints

- Show the generation of an SMS or app-based token.
- Include the step where the user verifies the token.
- Depict the final step where access is granted to the user upon successful verification.
