## Objective
Create a sequence diagram to illustrate the process of matching players in an online multiplayer game. The diagram should detail the steps from when players enter the queue to the initiation of a game session. This visualization will help in understanding the flow of actions and interactions between different components involved in the player matching process.

## Expected Diagram Format
Sequence Diagram: A type of diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case. It focuses on the sequence of messages exchanged between objects to carry out a specific function or process.

## Constraints
- Include the step where players enter the queue.
- Represent the skill-based matching algorithm that pairs players.
- Show the creation of a game lobby once players are matched.
- Depict the start of the game session after the lobby is created.

## Supplementary Data
