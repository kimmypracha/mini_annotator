## Reasoning Design

### 1. Task Type  
System-Design Task – This classification fits because the query involves creating a workflow process for an employee expense reimbursement system. The focus is on designing the components and their interactions rather than producing a single output.

### 2. Context Framing  
In a corporate setting, employees often incur expenses that need to be reimbursed by the company. A structured process ensures these reimbursements are handled efficiently and accurately, adhering to company policies and financial regulations.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
The system involves several entities and components:
- Employees: Individuals submitting reimbursement requests.
- Expense Reports: Documents detailing the expenses incurred.
- Approvers: Managers or supervisors who review and approve the expenses.
- Finance Department: Entity responsible for processing the approved reimbursements.
- Company Policy: Guidelines dictating allowable expenses and reimbursement limits.

- All expenses must comply with the company’s reimbursement policy.
- Approvals must be obtained from designated approvers before submission to the finance department.
- Reimbursements are processed within a specified time frame after approval.
- Expense reports must include valid receipts for all claimed expenses.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning to account for various interactions and decision points within the process. A flowchart effectively represents the sequential and conditional steps, showing how different components interact and ensuring compliance with policies.
