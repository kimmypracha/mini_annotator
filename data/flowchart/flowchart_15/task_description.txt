## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart to manage the escalation process for customer calls in a call center, ensuring efficient resolution and proper documentation at each level.

### Background or Scenario  
In a busy call center, customer service representatives (CSRs) handle incoming calls. When they cannot resolve an issue, the call must be escalated to a Team Leader, and if necessary, further escalated to a Manager. The goal is to ensure customer issues are resolved efficiently while maintaining a clear record of each interaction.

### Problem Specification
#### Input or Requirements  
- **Customer Call**: Details about the caller and the issue they are experiencing.  
- **CSR Availability**: Whether a CSR is available to take the call.  
- **Issue Type**: The category of the issue (e.g., billing, technical).  
- **Resolution Status**: Updated at each level to indicate if the issue is resolved.  
- **Documentation**: Record of the interaction and any actions taken.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- CSRs have a 10-minute window to resolve calls before escalation.  
- Team Leaders handle escalated calls, with a maximum of three calls at a time.  
- Managers are involved only if Team Leaders cannot resolve issues within 15 minutes.  
- All interactions must be documented thoroughly at each level of escalation.
