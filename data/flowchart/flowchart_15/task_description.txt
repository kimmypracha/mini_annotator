### Objective:
Design a logical process to manage the escalation of customer calls in a call center.

### Problem Specification:

**Process Input:**
The process must accept incoming customer calls, each with associated information such as the customer's issue type, urgency level, and any previous interaction history.

**Process Output:**
The process must determine the appropriate escalation path for each call, which could include transferring to a higher-level support agent, involving a supervisor, or providing a resolution at the current level.

**Constraints / Rules:**
1. Calls must be categorized based on issue type and urgency level.
2. Calls that cannot be resolved at the initial level must be escalated to a higher-level support agent.
3. If a call involves a high-priority issue or a dissatisfied customer, it must be escalated to a supervisor.
4. The process must allow for feedback loops where unresolved issues are re-evaluated for further escalation.
5. The process should aim to minimize customer wait time and ensure efficient resolution of issues.
