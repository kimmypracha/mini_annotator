## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
Algorithmic Task â€“ This classification fits because the query involves computing Fibonacci numbers using a recursive method, which is a computational process requiring defined inputs and outputs.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem involves calculating Fibonacci numbers, a well-known sequence in mathematics where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This task is framed in a computational context, focusing on implementing a recursive algorithm.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
- **n** (integer): The position in the Fibonacci sequence for which the number is to be computed.  
- The input is assumed to be a non-negative integer, as Fibonacci numbers are defined for such values.

### 4. Constraints  
- **n** must be a non-negative integer.
- The recursive computation should handle base cases explicitly: `Fibonacci(0) = 0` and `Fibonacci(1) = 1`.
- The process must be capable of handling large values of `n` within reasonable computational limits.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning because the recursive nature of the Fibonacci sequence involves repeated function calls, each requiring the computation of previous sequence values. A flowchart is appropriate to visually represent the decision points and recursive function calls, illustrating the branching nature of the computation.

## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart to compute the Fibonacci number at a given position `n` using a recursive approach.

### Background or Scenario  
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This task involves creating a recursive algorithm to compute the Fibonacci number at a specified position in the sequence.

### Problem Specification
#### Input or Requirements  
- **n** (integer): The position in the Fibonacci sequence for which the number is to be computed.

#### Output  
- **Fibonacci(n)** (integer): The Fibonacci number at position `n`.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- **n** must be a non-negative integer.
- Base cases are defined as:  
  - `Fibonacci(0) = 0`  
  - `Fibonacci(1) = 1`
- The recursion should efficiently handle computations for larger values of `n` within practical limits.
