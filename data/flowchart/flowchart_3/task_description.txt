## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart to compute the Fibonacci number at a given position `n` using a recursive approach.

### Background or Scenario  
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This task involves creating a recursive algorithm to compute the Fibonacci number at a specified position in the sequence.

### Problem Specification
#### Input or Requirements  
- **n** (integer): The position in the Fibonacci sequence for which the number is to be computed.

#### Output  
- **Fibonacci(n)** (integer): The Fibonacci number at position `n`.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- **n** must be a non-negative integer.
- Base cases are defined as:  
  - `Fibonacci(0) = 0`  
  - `Fibonacci(1) = 1`
- The recursion should efficiently handle computations for larger values of `n` within practical limits.
