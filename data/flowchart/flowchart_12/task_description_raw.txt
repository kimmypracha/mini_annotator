## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
System-Design Task â€“ This classification fits the query because enrolling in courses involves multiple entities and components such as students, courses, schedules, and prerequisites, which need to be organized into a coherent process.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem is set in the context of a university's course enrollment system, where students must navigate various requirements and system interactions to successfully enroll in their desired courses each semester.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
Entities involved include:
- Students: Individuals seeking to enroll in courses.
- Courses: Classes offered by the university, each with specific details such as prerequisites, credits, and availability.
- Enrollment System: The platform through which students select and enroll in courses.
- Academic Calendar: The timeline that dictates enrollment periods and deadlines.

### 4. Constraints  
- Students must meet all course prerequisites before enrolling.
- Enrollment is only open during specific dates as per the academic calendar.
- Courses have limited capacity, and enrollment is first-come, first-served.
- Students can only enroll in a maximum number of credits per semester.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning to manage various dependencies and constraints. A flowchart effectively represents the sequential and conditional steps students must follow, ensuring all requirements are met before successful enrollment.

## Problem Statement
