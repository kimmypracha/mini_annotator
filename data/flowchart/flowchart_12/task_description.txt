### Objective:
Design a logical process to manage the enrollment of students in university courses.

### Problem Specification:

- **Process Input:**
  - The process must accept student information, including their academic standing, major, and completed prerequisites.
  - A list of available courses, each with its own prerequisites, capacity limits, and schedule.
  - University enrollment policies, such as deadlines and priority rules (e.g., seniors have priority over juniors).

- **Process Output:**
  - The process must produce a confirmed list of courses in which the student is successfully enrolled.
  - A notification of any courses the student could not enroll in, along with reasons (e.g., full capacity, missing prerequisites).

- **Constraints / Rules:**
  - The process must ensure that students meet all prerequisites before enrolling in a course.
  - Enrollment must not exceed the maximum capacity of any course.
  - The process must adhere to university-specific enrollment periods and deadlines.
  - Students should not be enrolled in courses with scheduling conflicts.
