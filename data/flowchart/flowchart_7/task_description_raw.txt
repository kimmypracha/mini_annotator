## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
System-Design Task â€“ This classification fits because the query involves outlining a process that a development team follows, which can be described in terms of entities, components, and their relationships.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem is framed in the context of a software development team that needs to address and resolve a bug in their software application. This scenario is common in software development and requires a structured approach to ensure the issue is identified, analyzed, fixed, and verified.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
Entities involved include the development team, the software application, the bug report, testing tools, and version control systems. Components of the process include bug identification, prioritization, assignment, debugging, testing, and deployment.

### 4. Constraints  
- The bug must be reproducible to be worked on.
- The team must adhere to a pre-defined priority system for addressing bugs.
- All changes must be tracked using a version control system.
- The fix must be tested in a staging environment before deployment.
- Only authorized team members can approve the changes for production.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning because it involves multiple steps that depend on specific conditions and decisions. A flowchart is an appropriate representation as it can clearly illustrate the sequence of actions, decision points, and interactions between different components in the process.

## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart that outlines the steps a development team takes to resolve a software bug.

### Background or Scenario  
In a software development company, the development team is responsible for maintaining and improving a software application. Occasionally, bugs are reported that need to be addressed promptly to ensure the software's reliability and performance. The team follows a structured process to resolve these bugs efficiently.

### Problem Specification
#### Input or Requirements  
- Bug Report: A description of the bug, including steps to reproduce, observed behavior, and expected behavior.
- Development Team: Members with roles such as developers, testers, and project managers.
- Testing Tools: Software tools used to verify the bug fix.
- Version Control System: A platform for tracking changes and managing code versions.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- The bug must be reproducible as described in the bug report.
- Bugs are prioritized based on impact and urgency.
- Fixes must be reviewed and tested before deployment.
- Use of version control is mandatory for all code changes.
- Approval from a senior developer or project manager is required before deploying the fix to production.
