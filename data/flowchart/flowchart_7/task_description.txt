### Objective:
Design a logical process to guide a software development team in resolving a software bug efficiently.

### Problem Specification:

**Process Input:**
- The process must accept any bug report, which includes a description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant logs or error messages.

**Process Output:**
- The process must result in a resolved software bug, with documentation of the fix and any necessary updates to the software's codebase or user documentation.

**Constraints / Rules:**
- The process must prioritize bugs based on severity and impact on users.
- The process should include steps for verifying the bug, reproducing it reliably, and testing the fix in a controlled environment before deployment.
- The process must involve communication with stakeholders, including updates on progress and confirmation of resolution.
- The process should allow for collaboration among team members, utilizing version control systems and issue tracking tools.
- The process must ensure that the fix does not introduce new bugs or regressions in the software.
