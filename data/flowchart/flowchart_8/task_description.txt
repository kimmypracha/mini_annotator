## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart that outlines the process of escalating customer support tickets through various support tiers based on specific criteria.

### Background or Scenario  
Within a company's customer service department, support tickets submitted by customers are handled by support agents. Depending on the complexity and nature of the issue, tickets may need to be escalated through different support tiers to ensure they are resolved efficiently and effectively.

### Problem Specification  
#### Input or Requirements  
- **Customer Support Ticket:** Contains details of the customer issue.
- **Support Tiers:** Defined as Tier 1 (basic support), Tier 2 (advanced support), and Tier 3 (expert support).
- **Escalation Criteria:** Includes factors like issue complexity, time taken to resolve, severity level, and customer priority status.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- Tier 1 handles basic inquiries; unresolved issues or those beyond Tier 1â€™s scope are escalated.
- Tier 2 manages more complex issues; if unresolved within a set time, escalate to Tier 3.
- Tier 3 addresses the most complex or severe issues.
- Urgent or high-priority tickets may bypass tiers based on predefined rules.
- All escalations must be documented with reasons for escalation and action taken.
