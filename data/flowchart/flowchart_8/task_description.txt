### Objective:
Design a logical process to manage the escalation of customer support tickets through various support tiers.

### Problem Specification:

**Process Input:**
- The process must accept any customer support ticket, which includes details such as the issue description, customer priority level, and initial support tier.

**Process Output:**
- The process must determine the appropriate support tier for each ticket, ensuring it is escalated to the correct level based on predefined criteria.

**Constraints / Rules:**
- The process must begin with an initial assessment at the first support tier.
- Tickets must be escalated to a higher tier if they cannot be resolved within a specified time frame or if they meet certain severity criteria.
- Each tier must have defined criteria for escalation, including issue complexity, customer impact, and resource availability.
- The process must allow for de-escalation if a ticket is resolved at a higher tier but needs further action at a lower tier.
- The process must include a feedback loop to inform the customer of the ticket status at each stage of escalation.
