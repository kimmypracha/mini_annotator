## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
System-Design Task â€“ This classification fits because the query involves outlining a process with various legal steps and entities involved, rather than calculating an outcome or solving a specific task. The focus is on designing the workflow of a legal process.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem is set in the context of a landlord needing to evict a tenant due to non-payment of rent. This scenario is common in property management and requires adherence to legal procedures to ensure the eviction is lawful.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
Entities involved include the landlord, tenant, legal notices, and court systems. The process must consider the steps required by law to initiate and carry out an eviction due to non-payment.

### 4. Constraints  
- Legal notices must be served within specific time frames.
- The landlord must follow jurisdiction-specific laws and regulations.
- The tenant has certain rights and may contest the eviction.
- Court decisions are required before a physical eviction can proceed.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning to navigate through the legal steps, conditions, and possible outcomes. A flowchart is appropriate as it visually represents the sequence of actions, decisions, and legal requirements involved in the eviction process.

## Problem Statement
