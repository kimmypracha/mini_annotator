## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
Algorithmic Task â€“ This classification fits the query because Dijkstra's algorithm is a computational process that involves finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph, which can be represented using abstract reasoning and clear computational steps.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem is framed in the context of network routing or any situation where determining the shortest path between nodes in a graph is necessary. This is a common problem in computer science and operations research, where the goal is to optimize pathfinding.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
- **Graph (G):** A graph represented as a set of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes), where each edge has a non-negative weight (cost or distance).
- **Source Node (S):** The starting node from which the shortest paths to all other nodes in the graph are to be determined.

### 4. Constraints  
- The graph must be connected, meaning there is a path between any two nodes.
- All edge weights must be non-negative.
- The graph is finite, with a defined number of nodes and edges.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning because it involves iteratively selecting the shortest path while updating tentative distances and ensuring that each node is processed correctly. A flowchart is appropriate as it can visually represent the decision-making process and the iterative nature of the algorithm, clarifying the sequence of operations and conditions checked during execution.

## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### Background or Scenario  
You are tasked with developing a system that efficiently calculates the shortest paths in a network. This system will be used in applications such as GPS navigation, network routing, or any scenario that requires determining optimal paths.

### Problem Specification
#### Input or Requirements  
- **Graph (G):** A collection of nodes and edges, where each edge has a non-negative weight.
- **Source Node (S):** A specified starting point in the graph.

#### Output  
- A list or table showing the shortest path distances from the source node to each other node in the graph.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- The graph must be connected.
- All edge weights are non-negative.
- The graph is finite with a specified number of nodes and edges.
