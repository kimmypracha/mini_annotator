## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### Background or Scenario  
You are tasked with developing a system that efficiently calculates the shortest paths in a network. This system will be used in applications such as GPS navigation, network routing, or any scenario that requires determining optimal paths.

### Problem Specification
#### Input or Requirements  
- **Graph (G):** A collection of nodes and edges, where each edge has a non-negative weight.
- **Source Node (S):** A specified starting point in the graph.

#### Output  
- A list or table showing the shortest path distances from the source node to each other node in the graph.

#### Constraints or Rules  
- The graph must be connected.
- All edge weights are non-negative.
- The graph is finite with a specified number of nodes and edges.
