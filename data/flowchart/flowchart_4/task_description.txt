**Objective:**
Design a logical process to determine the shortest paths from a source node in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Problem Specification:**
- **Process Input:** The process must accept a weighted graph represented as a set of nodes and edges, where each edge has a non-negative weight, and a designated source node from which to calculate the shortest paths.
- **Process Output:** The process must yield a definitive list of the shortest paths from the source node to all other reachable nodes in the graph, including the total distance for each path.
- **Constraints / Rules:** The process must ensure that:
  1. Each node is visited only once to avoid cycles.
  2. The algorithm must handle graphs with varying edge weights and must not allow negative weights.
  3. The process must maintain a priority queue to efficiently select the next node with the smallest tentative distance.
