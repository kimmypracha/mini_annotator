### Objective:
Design a logical process to triage patients in an emergency room setting.

### Problem Specification:

- **Process Input:**
  - The process must accept information about each patient, including their symptoms, vital signs, age, medical history, and any immediate life-threatening conditions.

- **Process Output:**
  - The process must categorize each patient into a triage level, such as immediate, urgent, less urgent, or non-urgent, based on their condition and the severity of their symptoms.

- **Constraints / Rules:**
  - The process must prioritize patients with life-threatening conditions for immediate care.
  - The process should consider the availability of medical resources and staff when determining triage levels.
  - The process must be adaptable to handle a varying number of patients and a wide range of medical conditions.
  - The process must ensure that patients are reassessed periodically to update their triage level if their condition changes.
