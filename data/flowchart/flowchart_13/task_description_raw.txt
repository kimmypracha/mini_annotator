## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
System-Design Task â€“ This classification fits the query because the task involves designing a workflow process for requesting new IT equipment within a company. The focus is on structuring the steps and relationships between entities involved in the system rather than producing a specific output.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem is set within a corporate environment where employees may need to request new IT equipment, such as computers, accessories, or software, to perform their job duties effectively. A structured process ensures that requests are handled efficiently, approvals are obtained, and equipment is procured in a timely manner.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
Entities and components involved in the system include:
- Employee: The individual requesting new IT equipment.
- Manager: The person responsible for approving or denying the request.
- IT Department: The team that processes approved requests and procures the equipment.
- Procurement Department: The team responsible for purchasing the equipment.
- Equipment Inventory: A record of available equipment that might fulfill the request.

### 4. Constraints  
- Requests must be submitted using a designated form or system.
- Managers must approve requests before they are forwarded to the IT Department.
- The IT Department must check existing inventory before initiating a purchase.
- Budget limitations may affect approval and procurement processes.
- Requests must comply with company policies and standards for equipment.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning to handle multiple decision points and interactions between different departments. A flowchart is appropriate to visualize the sequence of steps, conditional branches based on approvals, and interactions between employees, managers, and departments.

## Problem Statement
