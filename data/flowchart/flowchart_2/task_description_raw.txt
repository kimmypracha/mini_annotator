## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
Specific Task â€“ This classification fits the query because it involves a realistic scenario of cooking in a kitchen using specific ingredients and tools.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem is set in the context of preparing a breakfast item, pancakes, using available kitchen ingredients and equipment. The task is about determining if one can make fluffy pancakes with the current resources.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
- Ingredients: Flour, milk, eggs, baking powder, sugar, salt, butter (specify quantities if known, or list as available).
- Kitchen Equipment: Mixing bowl, whisk, frying pan, spatula, measuring cups/spoons, stove.

### 4. Constraints  
- The ingredients must be from what is currently available in the kitchen; no additional shopping is allowed.
- The pancakes must be fluffy, which typically requires a specific ratio of ingredients and proper mixing techniques.
- The process must be completed using the available kitchen equipment.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
This task requires structured reasoning to determine if the available ingredients and equipment can produce the desired result (fluffy pancakes). A flowchart is appropriate as it helps visualize decision points, such as checking ingredient availability and adjusting quantities.

## Problem Statement
