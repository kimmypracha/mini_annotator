Design a logical process to facilitate the borrowing of a book from a library.

### Problem Specification:

- **Process Input:**
  - The process must accept a request from a library member to borrow a specific book. The request includes the member's ID and the book's title or ISBN.

- **Process Output:**
  - The process must determine whether the book can be borrowed and, if so, complete the transaction, updating the library's records accordingly.

- **Constraints / Rules:**
  - The member must have a valid library membership.
  - The book must be available in the library's inventory (i.e., not already checked out by another member).
  - The member must not have exceeded the maximum number of books allowed to be borrowed at one time.
  - The member must not have any outstanding fines or overdue books.
  - The process must update the library's inventory and the member's borrowing record upon successful borrowing.
