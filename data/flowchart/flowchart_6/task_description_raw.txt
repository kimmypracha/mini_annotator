## Reasoning Design
### 1. Task Type  
System-Design Task â€“ This classification fits because the query involves designing a workflow process, detailing the steps and entities involved from planning to project completion. The task does not result in a specific output but rather focuses on the structured process itself.

### 2. Context Framing  
The problem involves managing a project from its initial planning phase to its completion. This is a common scenario in project management across various industries, requiring coordination of tasks, resources, and timelines.

### 3. Input and Requirements  
Entities involved in the workflow include:  
- Project Manager  
- Project Team  
- Stakeholders  
- Resources (e.g., budget, materials, tools)  
- Timeline (start date, end date, milestones)  
- Project Goals and Objectives  

### 4. Constraints  
- The project must adhere to a predefined budget and timeline.  
- Stakeholder requirements and feedback must be integrated into the workflow.  
- Resource allocation must be efficient and within available limits.  
- Risk management strategies must be included to address potential project challenges.

### 5. Reasoning Challenge  
The task requires structured reasoning to map out a comprehensive workflow involving multiple stages and dependencies. A flowchart is appropriate as it visually represents the sequence of activities, decision points, and interactions between different entities, making it easier to understand and manage the project lifecycle.

## Problem Statement
### Objective  
Design a flowchart that outlines the workflow of managing a project from the planning phase to its completion.

### Background or Scenario
