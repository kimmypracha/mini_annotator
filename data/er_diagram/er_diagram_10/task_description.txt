## Problem Description

### Objective
The system is designed to manage and streamline the operations of a healthcare facility by efficiently organizing and tracking patient care, doctor interactions, appointments, treatments, and prescriptions.

### Scenario Description
In a healthcare facility, patients receive care from doctors through scheduled appointments. Each patient can have multiple appointments with one or more doctors, and each appointment is associated with specific treatments and, potentially, prescriptions. Treatments are tailored to the patient's medical needs and are administered during appointments. Prescriptions are issued by doctors and may be linked to specific treatments or given independently based on the patient's condition.

Doctors have unique specialties and can treat multiple patients, while patients may consult various doctors based on their health requirements. The system must track the history of appointments, treatments, and prescriptions for each patient to ensure continuity of care. Additionally, doctors need access to patient medical histories to make informed decisions about treatments and prescriptions.

### Constraints
- Each patient must have a unique identifier within the system to ensure accurate tracking of medical records.
- Doctors are categorized by specialty, which influences the types of treatments they can administer.
- Appointments must be scheduled with specific start and end times, and no two appointments for the same doctor can overlap.
- Treatments may require multiple sessions, which should be tracked individually yet linked to the original treatment plan.
- Prescriptions must include dosage instructions and a validity period, after which they cannot be refilled without a new consultation.
- The system should allow for the recording of appointment outcomes, including any changes in treatment plans or new prescriptions issued.
- Historical data for appointments, treatments, and prescriptions must be retained for at least five years to comply with regulatory requirements.
