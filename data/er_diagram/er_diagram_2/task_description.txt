## Problem Description

### Objective
The system is designed to manage and organize employee data, departmental structures, job roles, and salary records within a company's human resources department. It aims to facilitate efficient data management, support dynamic role assignments, and ensure accurate historical record-keeping.

### Scenario Description
In this HR system, each employee is associated with one or more job roles within the company. Employees can be assigned to specific departments, reflecting the company's organizational structure. Departments may have sub-departments, forming a hierarchical structure. Employees can change roles over time, and the system must track these changes to maintain accurate historical records.

Salary records are maintained for each employee, capturing salary adjustments over time due to promotions, role changes, or company-wide salary reviews. The system must ensure that salary records reflect the correct job role and department at the time of each adjustment. Additionally, the system should accommodate employees holding multiple roles simultaneously, each with potentially different salary structures.

### Constraints
- Employees must be linked to at least one department, but they can be associated with multiple departments if they hold cross-departmental roles.
- Each department can have multiple sub-departments, and a department can belong to only one parent department, forming a strict hierarchy.
- An employee can hold multiple job roles, and each role may have different salary structures.
- Historical salary records must be preserved, capturing the effective date of each salary change and the associated job role and department.
- Employees can be promoted or transferred between departments, and these changes must be reflected accurately in their role and salary records.
- The system should handle exceptions such as temporary roles or interim departmental assignments, ensuring these are recorded and managed appropriately.
