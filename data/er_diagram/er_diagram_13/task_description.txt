## Problem Description

### Objective
The system aims to support users in tracking their fitness activities, setting and achieving personal goals, and monitoring their progress over time.

### Scenario Description
The fitness tracking system is designed for individuals who want to manage their fitness routines and monitor their progress. Users can create accounts to access the system, where they can set personal fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or endurance improvement. Each user can participate in multiple workouts, which are collections of exercises performed during a session. Workouts can vary in type, such as cardio, strength, or flexibility, and users can log details about each session, including duration and intensity.

Exercises are the building blocks of workouts, and each exercise can be part of multiple workouts. Users can track their progress for each exercise, noting improvements in metrics like repetitions, weight lifted, or distance covered. The system should allow users to view historical data to assess their progress over time.

### Constraints
- Users must be able to set multiple concurrent fitness goals, which may have different target dates and metrics.
- Workouts can consist of a variable number of exercises, and the same exercise can appear in different workouts.
- Progress tracking should support historical data, allowing users to view past performance and trends.
- The system should accommodate different types of workouts and exercises, each with specific attributes that may vary (e.g., cardio vs. strength exercises).
- Users should be able to update their goals and progress data, with the system maintaining a history of changes for analysis.
- The system should ensure data integrity, particularly in recording and updating user progress and goal achievement status.
