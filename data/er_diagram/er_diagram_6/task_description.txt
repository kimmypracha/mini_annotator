### Objective
Design a data model for a real estate platform that supports the management of properties, agents, clients, and transactions.

### Scenario Description
In this real estate platform, various entities interact to facilitate the buying, selling, and renting of properties. The primary entities include:

- **Properties**: These are the real estate assets available for sale or rent. Each property has attributes such as location, size, price, and type (e.g., residential, commercial).

- **Agents**: Real estate agents manage the properties. They have attributes like name, contact information, and license number. An agent can manage multiple properties.

- **Clients**: These are individuals or organizations interested in buying, selling, or renting properties. Clients have attributes like name, contact details, and preferences.

- **Transactions**: These represent the deals made on properties, including sales and rentals. A transaction involves a property, an agent, and one or more clients. Transactions have attributes like date, amount, and type (sale or rent).

### Modeling Considerations
- **Role Overlap**: An individual might act as both a client and an agent in different transactions, requiring careful role management.
- **Derived Attributes**: The status of a property (e.g., available, under contract, sold) might be derived from its transactions.
- **Temporal Tracking**: Historical data on transactions and property listings should be maintained to analyze market trends.
- **Normalization Trade-offs**: Deciding the level of normalization, especially for transactions, to balance between data redundancy and query efficiency.
- **Edge Cases**: Handling scenarios where a property is co-listed by multiple agents or a transaction involves multiple clients.
