## Problem Description

### Objective
The system aims to manage and streamline the operations of a school by organizing information about students, courses, grades, teachers, and enrollments efficiently.

### Scenario Description
In a mid-sized educational institution, the administration needs a system to manage the academic records of students and facilitate the organization of courses and teaching assignments. Students enroll in various courses each semester, and each course is taught by one or more teachers. The system must track the grades that students receive in each course, which can vary from semester to semester.

Teachers may teach multiple courses, and courses can have different teachers assigned depending on the semester or academic year. The institution also needs to maintain records of which students are enrolled in which courses, and this enrollment can change each semester.

The system should accommodate the possibility of teachers also being students in other courses, reflecting the dynamic nature of roles within the academic environment. Additionally, the system should be capable of generating reports on student performance, course popularity, and teacher assignments.

### Constraints
1. Each course can have multiple sections, and each section can have different teachers and students.
2. Students can enroll in a maximum of five courses per semester to ensure manageable workloads.
3. Grades are awarded at the end of each semester, and the system must retain historical grade data for transcript generation.
4. Teachers can be assigned to teach a maximum of three courses per semester to maintain teaching quality.
5. The system must support the ability to add or remove courses and teachers without disrupting existing records.
6. Enrollment in a course requires prerequisite courses to be completed, where applicable, which must be verified before enrollment.
7. The system should allow for the future integration of online course components and virtual classrooms.
