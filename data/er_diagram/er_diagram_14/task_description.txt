## Problem Description

### Objective
Design a database system to support a social media platform that enables users to connect, share content, and interact within groups, while receiving timely notifications about relevant activities.

### Scenario Description
The social media platform allows users to create profiles, connect with other users as friends, and join interest-based groups. Users can create and share posts, which may be associated with their personal profile or with a group they belong to. Posts can include text, images, or videos, and users can interact with posts through comments and reactions.

Groups serve as communities for users with shared interests, and each group can have multiple members. Users can join multiple groups, and groups can have different privacy settings, affecting who can join or view content. Users receive notifications about activities such as new posts in their groups, comments on their posts, or friend requests. Notifications are time-sensitive and should be stored for historical reference.

### Constraints
- Users can have multiple friends, and friendships are mutual, requiring careful handling of bidirectional relationships.
- A user can be a member of multiple groups, and a group can have multiple users, necessitating a many-to-many relationship.
- Posts can be created by users and associated either with their profile or a group, introducing overlapping relationships.
- Notifications must be generated for specific events and stored with timestamps to track when they were created and viewed.
- Groups may have hierarchical structures, where sub-groups exist within larger groups, potentially affecting membership and content visibility.
- Privacy settings for users and groups must be considered, influencing who can view or interact with certain posts and notifications.
