### Objective\nDesign a platform to manage a learning management system (LMS) that supports educational activities and tracks user engagement and performance.\n\n### Scenario Description\nThe LMS must accommodate various types of users, including students, instructors, and administrators. Users can enroll in multiple courses, each of which comprises several lessons. Instructors are responsible for creating and managing courses and lessons. Students enroll in courses and complete lessons and assessments.\n\nCourses may have prerequisites that students must fulfill before enrolling. Lessons are the building blocks of courses and contain educational content. Assessments are linked to either specific lessons or entire courses and are used to evaluate student performance.\n\nThe system should also track enrollment data, including the date of enrollment and completion status. Users may have multiple roles, such as a student who is also an instructor for another course.\n\n### Modeling Considerations\n- Users can have dynamic roles, acting as students in some courses and instructors in others.\n- Courses may have prerequisites, which could be modeled as relationships between courses.\n- Lessons might be standalone entities or part of a course, requiring a decision on how to model their relationship.\n- Assessments could be linked to lessons or courses, affecting how they are related to other entities.\n- Enrollment records should capture historical data, such as enrollment dates and completion status, necessitating careful consideration of temporal data management.\n- Consider opportunities for abstraction, such as creating a general 'UserRole' entity to manage user roles across different contexts.
