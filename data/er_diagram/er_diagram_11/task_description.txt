## Problem Description

### Objective
Design a database system to support a ticketing platform that manages events, venues, users, ticket sales, and payments, ensuring efficient tracking and management of all related data.

### Scenario Description
The ticketing platform serves as a central hub for managing events across various venues. Users can browse upcoming events, purchase tickets, and make payments through the platform. Each event is associated with a specific venue, which has a defined capacity and location. Users can register on the platform to buy tickets, and they may also be attendees of the events. The system must handle multiple types of events, such as concerts, sports matches, and theater performances, each with unique attributes like start time, duration, and special requirements (e.g., age restrictions).

Tickets are sold for specific events and must be tracked from purchase to event attendance. The platform supports multiple payment methods, and each transaction must be securely recorded, including details such as payment amount, method, and timestamp. The system should also allow for dynamic pricing based on demand and event proximity. Additionally, the platform must provide a way to manage refunds and cancellations, adhering to specific business rules.

### Constraints
- Each event must be associated with one or more venues, and each venue can host multiple events, but not simultaneously.
- Users can purchase multiple tickets for different events, but each ticket must be uniquely associated with a single user and event.
- The system must track historical data for ticket sales and payments, including any refunds or cancellations.
- Venue capacity must be enforced, ensuring that ticket sales do not exceed the available seats.
- Payment transactions must be securely recorded, with support for various payment methods, and linked to the corresponding ticket sales.
- The system should allow for dynamic pricing adjustments based on predefined rules, such as time to event or ticket demand.
- Users may have roles that evolve over time, such as becoming VIP members, which may affect ticket pricing and availability.
