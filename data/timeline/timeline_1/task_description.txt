Reconstruct the timeline for publishing a book, from initial outlining to final marketing efforts. This involves understanding the sequence and dependencies of various phases, such as writing, editing, design, and promotion, each with its own duration and potential overlaps.

Use _Mermaidâ€™s gantt chart_ because the scenario involves durations, dependencies, and parallel tasks.

#### Event Space
1. **Outlining Phase**: This initial phase involves creating a detailed outline of the book's content. It typically takes about two weeks and must be completed before the writing begins.

2. **Writing Phase**: Writing the manuscript is a lengthy process, taking approximately three months. This phase starts immediately after the outlining is finished.

3. **First Round of Editing**: Once the manuscript is complete, it undergoes the first round of editing, which takes about one month. This phase cannot start until the writing phase is completed.

4. **Cover Design**: The cover design process runs concurrently with the first round of editing and takes around three weeks.

5. **Second Round of Editing**: After the first round of edits, the manuscript goes through a second round of editing, lasting two weeks. This phase follows the first round of editing.

6. **Final Proofreading**: This phase takes about one week and occurs after the second round of editing.

7. **Formatting**: Once proofreading is complete, the book is formatted for print and digital versions. This takes about two weeks and must be completed before publishing.

8. **Publishing**: The publishing phase involves uploading the book to various platforms and takes about one week. It follows the formatting phase.

9. **Marketing and Promotion**: Marketing efforts start during the final proofreading phase and continue for a month after publishing, overlapping with the publishing phase.

#### Constraints

- Cover design runs in parallel with the first round of editing.
- The second round of editing follows the first round.
- Final proofreading must wait for the second round of editing to finish.
