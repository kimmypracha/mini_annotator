Reconstruct the timeline for planning a wedding over the course of a year, focusing on key tasks and milestones that must be completed in sequence or in parallel. This includes booking the venue, sending invitations, arranging catering, dress fittings, and rehearsals.

Expected Diagram Format: Use Mermaidâ€™s gantt chart because this scenario involves durations, start-after constraints, and dependencies between tasks.

Event Space:
1. **Venue Booking**: This is one of the first tasks and must be completed before invitations can be sent. It typically takes about a month to finalize.
2. **Invitation Design and Printing**: Begins after the venue is booked and takes approximately two months to complete.
3. **Invitation Mailing**: Starts immediately after invitations are printed and takes about two weeks.
4. **Catering Arrangements**: Can begin once the venue is booked and should be finalized at least six months before the wedding.
5. **Dress Fittings**: Begin parallel to catering arrangements and require multiple sessions over several months, concluding two months before the wedding.
6. **Rehearsal Dinner Planning**: Starts three months before the wedding and requires coordination with the venue and catering.
7. **Final Venue Walkthrough**: Occurs one month before the wedding to ensure all arrangements are in place.
8. **Wedding Rehearsal**: Takes place the day before the wedding.

Constraints:
- Invitations cannot be sent until the venue is booked and the design is finalized.
- Catering and dress fittings run in parallel but must be completed well before the wedding.
- The rehearsal dinner planning must consider the availability of the venue and catering services.
- The final venue walkthrough is dependent on all prior arrangements being confirmed.
