## The Scenario

### Background  
The company is preparing to launch a new tech gadget. The marketing team must develop a comprehensive campaign to generate buzz and drive sales. The team consists of content creators, designers, and analysts, each with specific roles. The campaign must be ready in time for the product launch, which is a fixed date.

### Objective

2. **Content Creation**  
   Writers and designers develop marketing materials, including blog posts, social media content, and visuals. This phase requires five days and involves collaboration between content creators and designers.

3. **Ad Scheduling**  
   The advertising team plans and schedules digital ads across various platforms. This task takes three days and requires coordination with the content team to ensure alignment with campaign themes.

4. **Team Collaboration Meeting**  
   A meeting is held to review progress, align on strategies, and address any challenges. This involves the entire team and takes one day.

5. **Performance Tracking Setup**  
   Analysts set up tools and metrics for tracking campaign performance. This task takes two days and involves configuring analytics platforms and defining KPIs.

6. **Campaign Launch**  
   The campaign goes live across all channels. This involves the entire team and lasts one day, marking the official start of the marketing efforts.
