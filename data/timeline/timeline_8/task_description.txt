Reconstruct the timeline for completing a research paper, starting from the literature review and ending with the final submission. This involves several stages, including drafting, peer review, and revisions, each with specific dependencies and durations.

Expected Diagram Format: Use Mermaidâ€™s gantt chart because the scenario involves tasks with durations, dependencies, and potential overlaps.

Event Space:
1. **Literature Review**: This phase involves gathering and reviewing relevant literature. It takes approximately three weeks and must be completed before drafting begins.

2. **Drafting the Paper**: Writing the initial draft takes about four weeks and can start immediately after the literature review is completed.

3. **Initial Peer Review**: Once the draft is complete, it is sent for peer review. This process takes about two weeks and must be completed before any revisions can be made.

4. **Revisions**: Based on peer review feedback, revisions are made. This stage takes approximately two weeks and cannot begin until the peer review is completed.

5. **Final Proofreading**: After revisions, the paper undergoes final proofreading, which takes about one week. This can only start after revisions are complete.

6. **Submission**: The final step is submitting the paper. This is a one-day task that occurs immediately after proofreading.

Constraints:
- Drafting cannot begin until the literature review is complete.
- Revisions depend on the completion of the peer review.
- Proofreading requires the revisions to be finished first.
- Submission follows immediately after proofreading, with no delay.
