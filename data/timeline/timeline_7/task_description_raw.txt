## Strategic Reasoning

### The Scenario Context
The persona is a project manager at a mid-sized software company. The company is preparing for a major software release with a tight deadline and limited resources, requiring careful coordination across multiple teams (development, testing, and operations). 

### Complexity and Diagram Choice
The scenario involves multiple phases with distinct durations and dependencies, making a Gantt chart the appropriate choice. This will help visualize task overlaps, resource allocation, and critical paths.

### Rationale for Event Selection
The selected events encompass key stages in a software development lifecycle, each with unique challenges and dependencies. This mix tests the planner's ability to prioritize tasks, manage resource constraints, and ensure timely completion.

### Scenario Plausibility
The scenario reflects common industry practices and challenges, such as iterative development, testing cycles, and cross-team collaboration. The constraints mimic real-world resource limitations and approval processes.

## The Scenario

### Background  
The software company is launching a new application feature. The project manager must coordinate between development, testing, and operations teams to ensure a smooth release. The company has a history of delayed releases, so this project is under scrutiny to meet the deadline.

### Objective  
Successfully release the new software feature to production, ensuring it meets quality standards and is delivered on time.

### Event Descriptions  

1. **Feature Planning Meeting**  
   The product team conducts a detailed planning session to outline feature requirements and specifications. This involves product managers, developers, and designers. Estimated duration: 3 days.

2. **Development Phase**  
   The development team writes code for the new feature. This phase requires collaboration among developers and code reviews. Estimated duration: 15 days.

3. **Initial Testing**  
   The quality assurance team performs initial testing to identify major bugs. This phase involves setting up test environments and running automated tests. Estimated duration: 5 days.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
   Selected users test the feature in a controlled environment to ensure it meets their needs. This involves feedback collection and minor adjustments by developers. Estimated duration: 7 days.

5. **Code Freeze**  
   The development team stops all new code changes to stabilize the feature for final testing and deployment preparations. Estimated duration: 2 days.

6. **Final Testing and Approval**  
   The quality assurance team conducts final testing, including security and performance checks. Approval from the product manager is required before deployment. Estimated duration: 4 days.

7. **Production Deployment**  
   The operations team deploys the feature to the production environment. This involves coordination with the development team for any last-minute adjustments. Estimated duration: 1 day.

### Constraints  

- Development cannot start until the feature planning meeting is completed.
- Initial testing requires the development phase to be at least 50% complete.
- User acceptance testing cannot begin until initial testing is finalized and major bugs are resolved.
- Code freeze must occur before final testing and approval.
- Production deployment requires final testing approval and coordination with both development and operations teams.
