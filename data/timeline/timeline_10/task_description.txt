## The Scenario

### Background  
The event planning team is responsible for organizing an annual conference that attracts industry professionals from across the country. The conference's success is crucial for the organization's reputation and future funding. The team must balance logistical challenges, such as venue booking and speaker coordination, with promotional efforts to maximize attendance.

### Objective  
The primary goal is to execute a successful conference that meets attendance targets, receives positive feedback, and strengthens the organization's standing in the industry.

### Event Descriptions  
1. **Venue Booking**  
   The team secures a suitable venue that can accommodate all attendees and technical requirements. The venue selection involves negotiations with the venue management and requires a deposit. Estimated duration: 2 weeks.

2. **Speaker Coordination**  
   The team reaches out to potential speakers, confirms their participation, and coordinates travel and accommodation arrangements. This involves contract negotiations and managing speaker schedules. Estimated duration: 3 weeks.

3. **Attendee Registration Setup**  
   The team sets up an online registration system, ensuring it is user-friendly and secure. This includes testing the system and troubleshooting any issues. Estimated duration: 1 week.

4. **Promotional Campaign**  
   The marketing team launches a promotional campaign to attract attendees. This includes social media marketing, email blasts, and partnerships with industry publications. Estimated duration: 4 weeks.

5. **Vendor Coordination**  
   The team coordinates with vendors for catering, audio-visual equipment, and other necessary services. This involves reviewing contracts and ensuring all logistical needs are met. Estimated duration: 2 weeks.

6. **Conference Day Execution**  
   The team oversees the conference day, ensuring all sessions run smoothly, addressing any issues that arise, and managing attendee flow. This requires on-the-ground coordination and problem-solving. Estimated duration: 1 day.

7. **Post-Event Follow-Up**  
   After the conference, the team sends thank-you notes to speakers and attendees, gathers feedback through surveys, and conducts a debrief meeting to assess the event's success. Estimated duration: 1 week.

### Constraints  
- The venue booking must be finalized before any promotional activities can begin.
- Speaker coordination cannot start until the venue is confirmed, as speakers need venue details.
- The attendee registration system must be operational before the promotional campaign launches.
- Vendor coordination requires the venue's technical specifications, which are only available after booking.
- Post-event follow-up is contingent on the completion of the conference day execution.
