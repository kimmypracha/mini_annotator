Organizing an annual conference requires careful planning and coordination of multiple tasks. The process includes booking the venue, coordinating with speakers, managing attendee registration, promoting the event, and conducting post-event follow-up. Each task has specific dependencies and durations that must be considered to ensure a successful event.

Use _Mermaidâ€™s gantt chart_ to represent the tasks, durations, and dependencies involved in organizing the conference.

### Event Space
1. **Venue Booking**: This task must be completed before any other activities can begin. It typically takes about a month to finalize the contract and logistics.
2. **Speaker Coordination**: Begins shortly after the venue is confirmed. This involves reaching out to potential speakers, which takes about two months, and must be completed before promotional activities can start.
3. **Attendee Registration**: Opens once the speakers are confirmed and runs in parallel with promotional activities. Registration typically remains open for three months.
4. **Promotional Activities**: Start as soon as the speakers are confirmed and run concurrently with registration, lasting for about two months.
5. **Event Execution**: Occurs over three days, following the completion of registration and promotional activities.
6. **Post-Event Follow-Up**: Begins immediately after the event and lasts for about two weeks, involving feedback collection and financial reconciliation.

### Constraints
- Venue booking must be completed before speaker coordination can begin.
- Speaker coordination must be finalized before promotional activities and registration can start.
- Promotional activities and attendee registration run concurrently but must both be completed before the event execution.
- Post-event follow-up cannot start until the event execution is complete.
