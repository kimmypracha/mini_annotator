## The Scenario

### Background  
A construction project manager is tasked with overseeing the build of a new residential building. The project is located in an urban area with limited space for staging materials and equipment. The client expects a high-quality finish and has set a firm move-in date. The manager must coordinate various subcontractors and manage resources efficiently to meet the deadline.

### Objective  
The goal is to complete the construction of the residential building on time and within budget, ensuring all quality standards are met. Success depends on effective scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management.

2. **Foundation Work**  
   Excavation and pouring of the building's foundation. This requires precision and favorable weather conditions. Duration: 3 weeks.

3. **Structural Framing**  
   Erection of the building's framework, including walls and roof trusses. Multiple crews work simultaneously. Duration: 4 weeks.

- Plumbing and electrical installation must be completed before any interior finishing begins.
- Exterior finishing is weather-dependent and may require additional buffer time for delays.
- Inspection and quality assurance must be completed before landscaping and site cleanup can begin.
