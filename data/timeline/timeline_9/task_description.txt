## The Scenario

### Background  
The clinical trial is for a new cardiovascular drug. The trial must navigate regulatory approvals, recruit a diverse patient population, and ensure data integrity. Limited funding and a competitive market add pressure to expedite results without compromising quality.

### Objective  
Successfully complete the clinical trial, from protocol development to the final report, ensuring regulatory compliance and timely patient recruitment to support the drug's market approval.

### Event Descriptions  
1. **Protocol Development**  
   The research team drafts a detailed trial protocol. This involves collaboration between scientists and medical professionals to outline objectives, methodologies, and safety measures. Estimated duration: 4 weeks.

2. **Regulatory Approval**  
   The protocol is submitted to regulatory authorities for review. Approval is contingent on meeting ethical and safety standards. Estimated duration: 6 weeks.

3. **Patient Recruitment**  
   The recruitment team targets hospitals and clinics to enroll a diverse patient cohort. Efforts focus on outreach and screening for eligibility. Estimated duration: 8 weeks.

4. **Site Preparation**  
   Clinical sites are prepared, including staff training and equipment setup. This ensures readiness for patient visits and data collection. Estimated duration: 3 weeks.

5. **Data Collection**  
   Enrolled patients undergo treatment and monitoring. Data is collected on drug efficacy and safety, requiring coordination with clinical staff. Estimated duration: 12 weeks.

6. **Data Analysis**  
   The data analysis team processes and interprets trial data to assess outcomes. This phase involves statistical analysis and reporting. Estimated duration: 4 weeks.

7. **Final Report Preparation**  
   A comprehensive report is compiled, detailing trial results and conclusions. This report is crucial for regulatory submission and publication. Estimated duration: 3 weeks.

### Constraints  
- Regulatory approval must be obtained before patient recruitment can commence.
- Site preparation must be completed before data collection begins.
- The same clinical staff is required for both patient recruitment and data collection phases.
- Data analysis cannot start until all data has been collected.
- The final report preparation relies on the completion of data analysis.
