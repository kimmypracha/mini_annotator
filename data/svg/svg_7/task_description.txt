## Objective
Create a diagram that illustrates the layers of the Internet Protocol Stack (TCP/IP model) to facilitate understanding of how data moves through each layer. The diagram should clearly depict the four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access. It should also demonstrate the process of data encapsulation as it passes through each layer, providing a visual representation that simplifies the concept for educational purposes.

## Expected Diagram Format
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)  
SVG is a widely-used XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics. It is ideal for creating diagrams that need to be scalable and interactive, making it suitable for illustrating complex concepts like the TCP/IP model.

## Constraints
- The diagram must clearly show the four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access.
- Include examples of protocols for each layer:
  - Application: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
  - Transport: TCP, UDP
  - Internet: IP, ICMP
  - Network Access: Ethernet, Wi-Fi
- Use visual metaphors to effectively represent the concept of data encapsulation as data moves through the layers.

## Supplementary Data
- **Application Layer**: Provides user interface and application services. Example protocols include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
- **Transport Layer**: Responsible for end-to-end communication and reliability. Example protocols include TCP and UDP.
- **Internet Layer**: Handles routing and addressing. Example protocols include IP and ICMP.
- **Network Access Layer**: Manages the physical transmission of data. Example protocols include Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
